## Project Description
uAttendance is a website that helps teachers to take attendance in their classes, this website works by uploading each student's picture and group pictures that works as reference to take the attendance. This app uses Rekognition from Amazon Web Services in order to compare pictures and in that way be able to take the attendance. Another feature of uAttendance is the Facial Login that let users Login in a really easier and faster way, this is achieved by uploading a picture during the signup in the application and also using Rekognition from Amazon Web Services.
